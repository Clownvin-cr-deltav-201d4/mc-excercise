My name is Alice and I really cant stand Carol. Lately she's been so passive aggressive and shitty to me. I can't wait to tell her I slept with her husband last winter. 

I hate this Alice biotch, always stealing my coffee mug...

Today Carol literally tried to trip me. So I called her a hussy and slapped her across the face. So during her lunch break SHE KEYED MY VOLVO. I really think I'm gonna lose it. I've been thinking about buying a gun...
