I hate this Alice biotch, always stealing my coffee mug...

Today alice was a total piece o' work, she kept interrupting me and saying
my ideas are shit. I told he she can f off, and that she should start locking her doors at night. Later, I keyed her car. Now she's always just super angry with me, and I don't know why
Maybe I should buy a pitbull to guard my stuff.
