My name is Alice and I really cant stand Carol. Lately she's been so passive aggressive and shitty to me. I can't wait to tell her I slept with her husband last winter. 

I hate this Alice biotch, always stealing my coffee mug...

Today Carol literally tried to trip me. So I called her a hussy and slapped her across the face. So during her lunch break SHE KEYED MY VOLVO. I really think I'm gonna lose it. I've been thinking about buying a gun... 

It is a common misconception that the common weeaboo is an unhygienic, overweight male. Modern weeaboos have fairly well assimilated into human society as they have learned that this may bring certain benefits. As such the common weeaboo might even shower regularly, dress decently well, and even go to the gym on most days to attract a female, if only to later ask her to dress up in a Japanese middleschool sailor uniform or in cat ears for him.

For those who are inexperienced with the common traits of the closet weeaboo it can be difficult to spot him as he hides his traits from the public (commonly referred to as hiding ones power level). As such it is not only possible but even likely that many people one interacts with on a daily basis, such as co-workers, friends, or even your boss, may belong to this species.
