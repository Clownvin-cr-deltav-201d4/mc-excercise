My name is Alice and I really cant stand Carol. Lately she's been so passive aggressive and shitty to me. I can't wait to tell her I slept with her husband last winter. 

I hate this Alice biotch, always stealing my coffee mug...

Today Carol literally tried to trip me. So I called her a hussy and slapped her across the face. So during her lunch break SHE KEYED MY VOLVO. I really think I'm gonna lose it. I've been thinking about buying a gun...

Carol's husband Greg broke down and told Carol about the affair during some huge fight. She drove drunk over to my apartment and started banging on the door yelling. I decided to let her in thinking we could probably just talk it out and maybe even start working towards being friends again. She immediately started trying to strangle me and got pretty close. But as she pushed me to the ground she knocked down a steak knife. I grabbed it and stuck it in her neck. She gurgled wide eyed, and fell over.
